Collection/Collections are used for holding groups of objects. Collections havebuilt in sort
functions that can be overriden. Comparable and Comparator are used for ordering those objects.
Comparable is the means by which objects are naturally ordered in their set/list/whatever.
Comparators are for when you want to order them in some other way according to some other
criteria. As for "where they are," comparables and comparators are both their own defined
interfaces that get implemented by the class that is going to use them.
